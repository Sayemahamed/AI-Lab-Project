## Overview
This project leverages deep learning technology to analyze chest X-ray images for potential COVID-19 indicators using the comprehensive COVID-19 Radiography Dataset. Built with PyTorch and featuring an intuitive Streamlit web interface, this tool demonstrates the potential of AI in medical image analysis while maintaining a focus on research and educational exploration.

## Dataset

The COVID-19 Radiography Dataset is a comprehensive collection of chest X-ray images created by researchers from Qatar University, University of Dhaka, and their collaborators. The dataset contains:

### COVID-19 Images (3,616 total)
- 2,473 images from padchest dataset
- 183 images from German medical school
- 559 images from SIRM, Github, Kaggle & Twitter
- 400 images from additional Github sources

### Normal Images (10,192 total)
- 8,851 images from RSNA
- 1,341 images from Kaggle

### Additional Classes (not used in this project)
- 6,012 Lung Opacity images (Non-COVID lung infection) from RSNA
- 1,345 Viral Pneumonia images from various sources

All images are in PNG format with 299x299 pixel resolution. The dataset is regularly updated with new X-ray images as they become available.

## Features

- Deep learning model for COVID-19 detection from X-rays
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Data augmentation and preprocessing pipeline
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Medical disclaimer for responsible use
